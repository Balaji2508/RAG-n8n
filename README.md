🚀 Excited to share my latest RAG project built using n8n, Google Drive, Pinecone, and Gemini AI! 🧠📁
I built an automated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline where:
📥 A file uploaded to Google Drive triggers the workflow.
🔽 It's downloaded and processed automatically.
📚 Text is split, embedded using Google Gemini Embeddings, and stored in Pinecone Vector DB.
🤖 A custom AI agent (powered by Gemini Chat Model) responds to queries using the relevant context from uploaded files.
✨ This project automates document-based Q&A using powerful LLMs — ideal for creating smart assistants, internal search tools, and more!
📌 Tech used:
 🔹 Google Drive API
 🔹 Pinecone Vector Store
 🔹 Gemini Embeddings & Chat Model
 🔹 n8n (no-code automation)
 🔹 OpenAI (optional embedding variant)
This was a great learning experience in integrating tools across cloud storage, vector databases, and LLMs — pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI automation 💡
